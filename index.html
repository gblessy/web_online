		<h1>Web Developer Path Explained</h1>
		<div><h2> 5 Easy Steps to become a web developer:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Start studying courses on Web Developement in English. Bellow you can find recomended list of courses to take. Post all the meaningfull code, that you are going to write during your studies, to github. Apply gained skills to write your own pet projects and post it to github also.</li> 
		 		<li>Create a page on LinekedIn and write there, that you are JS developer freelancer, when you starting your studies.</li>
				<li>Prepare a CV, where you can write eveything that you have learned on courses as an experience and write in technologies, all the technologies that you have used during your studies. And when you feeling ready to get a job post it online and send to the positions, that you are interested in. You might even want to find someone, who works at that company on LinkedIn and ask them to refer you there.</li>
				<li>Fail on few first interview and make a list of things that you couldn't answer during the interview. You can use some simple site as 
				<a href="https://sheltered-gorge-83437.herokuapp.com/">this one</a>, to track your interwiew questions and read questions, that other had on their interviews.</li>
				<li>Get you first development job! And keep studying advanced materials to know Algorithms and Design Patterns to be able to land you Dream Job at the company of your Dreams.</li>
			</ol>
		 </div>	
		<div>Here is a list of courses that people studied and were able to find a job afterwards. Any of those materials can be bought on a sale on Udemy for 10$ or downloaded from internet, while I would incourage you to invest money in your education. That way you would be more motivated to pay it back.</div>
		<h2>Mast Watch Courses</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The first course which I recommend to all the beginners is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" class="btn btn-success">Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy</a>.</li>
				<li>To understand JS better watch <a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/" >Modern Java Sript Bootcamp</a>.</li>
				<li>In order to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer you would be required to know some FrontEnd Framework. So one of the most popular frameworks at the moment is React. So here is a great tutorial, that would allow you to master React: <a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/">The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)</a>.</li>
			</ul>		
		<div>Usually, if you would pass those 3 courses, you would be able to get a job as a web developer.</div>
