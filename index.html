		<h1>Web Developer Path Explained</h1>
		<div><h2>Steps to become web developer:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Start studying courses on Web Developement in English. Bellow you can find recomended list of courses to take.</li> 
		 		<li>At the same time, create a page on LinekedIn and write there, that you are JS developer freelancer.</li>
				<li>Post all the meaningfull code, that you are going to write during your studies, to github. Apply gained skills to write your own pet projects and post it to github also.</li>
				<li>When you feeling ready to get a job, prepare a CV, where you can write eveything that you have learned on courses as an experience and write in technologies, all the technologies that you have used during your studies.</li>
				<li>Make a list of companies, where you want to work and DON'T send your CV there at first.</li>
				<li>Find companies, where you wouldn't want to work and send your CV there. You might even want to find someone, who works at that company on LinkedIn and ask them to refer you there.</li>
				<li>Fail on few first interview and make a list of things that you couldn't answer during the interview. You can use some simple site as 
				<a href="https://sheltered-gorge-83437.herokuapp.com/">this one</a>, to track your interwiew questions and read questions, that other had on their interviews.</li>
				<li>Get you first development job! And keep studying advanced materials to know Algorithms and Design Patterns to be able to land you Dream Job at the company of your Dreams.</li>
			</ol>
		 </div>	
		<div>Here is a list of courses that people studied and were able to find a job afterwards. Any of those materials can be bought on a sale on Udemy for 10$ or downloaded from internet, while I would incourage you to invest money in your education. That way you would be more motivated to pay it back.</div>
		<h2>Mast Watch Courses</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The first cours which I recommend to all the beginners is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy</a>.</li>
				<li>To understand JS better watch <a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/">Java Sript Understanding Wierd Parts</a>.</li>
				<li>In order to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer you would be required to know some FrontEnd Framework. So one of the most popular frameworks at the moment is React. So here is a great tutorial, that would allow you to master React: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/">The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)</a>.</li>
