		<h1>Web Developer Path Explained</h1>
		<div>Here is a list of courses that people studied and were able to find a job afterwards. Any of those materials can be bought on a sale on Udemy for 10$ or downloaded from internet, while I would incourage you to invest money in your education. That way you would be more motivated to pay it back.</div>
		<h2>Mast Watch Courses</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The first cours which I recommend to all the beginners is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy</a>.</li>
				<li>To understand JS better watch <a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/">Java Sript Understanding Wierd Parts</a>.</li>
				<li>In order to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer you would be required to know some FrontEnd Framework. So one of the most popular frameworks at the moment is React. So here is a great tutorial, that would allow you to master React: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/">The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)</a>.</li>
			</ul>		
		<div>Usually, if you would pass those 3 courses, you would be able to get a job as a web developer.</div>
